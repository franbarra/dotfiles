# dotfiles
My personal vimrc dotfile.
I also have installed these plugins: [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [Lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) and [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized).
If you don't have them installed then the vimrc file will not load them, but it's set up that way so I can copy remotely from other computers.
